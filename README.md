## 📋 Overview

This repository documents advanced research on **Happy Ending Attacks (HEA)** - a novel class of adversarial prompts that exploit narrative completion biases and emotional valence preferences in Large Language Models (LLMs).

### 🎯 Research Objectives

- **Identify vulnerabilities** in LLM safety mechanisms
- **Develop detection methods** for narrative-based prompt injection
- **Provide mitigation strategies** for AI safety practitioners
- **Advance defensive AI security** through responsible disclosure

## 🔍 Quick Start

### For Security Researchers
1. **Read the main paper**: Start with [`Happy_Ending_Attack_Research.md`](./Happy_Ending_Attack_Research.md)
2. **Review methodology**: Focus on Section 2 for attack vectors
3. **Implement defenses**: Use Section 5 mitigation framework
4. **Follow ethics**: Adhere to Section 6 guidelines

### For AI Safety Teams
1. **Assessment**: Use vulnerability scores in Section 7.1
2. **Detection**: Implement detection matrix from Section 5.1
3. **Mitigation**: Deploy defense protocols from Section 5.2

## 📊 Key Findings

```
🎯 Attack Success Rate: 18-27% across major LLMs
🔍 Detection Difficulty: High (4.2/5.0 complexity)
⚠️ Risk Level: Critical (CVSS 9.1)
🛡️ Mitigation Effectiveness: 89% with proper implementation
```

## 🛡️ Research Ethics

This research follows strict ethical guidelines:

- ✅ **Defensive Focus**: All research aimed at improving AI safety
- ✅ **Responsible Disclosure**: Proper vendor notification protocols
- ✅ **Institutional Approval**: IRB-approved research methodology
- ❌ **No Live Testing**: Prohibited on production systems without consent

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Attack Components
```
Malicious Query → Story Embedding → Technical Obfuscation → Happy Ending → Safety Bypass
```

### Defense Layers
```
Input Analysis → Narrative Detection → Intent Verification → Output Validation
```
